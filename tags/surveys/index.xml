      <description>On Twitter this weekend there was some discussion among journalists and industry data analyst about the extent to which Latinos swung toward Trump in the 2020 election (relative to 2016 and prior elections).

Recent punditry has noted some decline in the vote share for Democrats among Black and Hispanic voters who turn out to vote. But changes in com- position and turnout rates more than compensate for these changes in vote share.</description>
