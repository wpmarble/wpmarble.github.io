      <title>Deep Learning and Knowledge Representation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nautil.us/deep-learning-is-hitting-a-wall-14467/&#34;&gt;Deep Learning is Hitting A Wall&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; Gary Marcus argues that deep learning is reaching its limits as a paradigm for artificial intelligence. Recent difficulties with self-driving cars and unreliable language model outputs illustrate the limitations of systems that cannot &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the world, or the meaning of the words they are &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922&#34;&gt;parroting&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, Marcus advocates that field of AI turn its attention to symbolic approaches. Such approaches would focus on encoding information about the world and deriving information using simple operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does &amp;ldquo;manipulating symbols&amp;rdquo; really mean? Ultimately, it means two things: having sets of symbols (essentially just patterns that stand for things) to represent information, and processing (manipulating) those symbols in a specific way, using something like algebra (or logic, or computer programs) to operate over those symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is as interesting for its exposition of symbolic approaches (relatively unknown to me) as for its sociology of science. Embraced by early computer scientists such as von Nuemann, symbolic approaches became dominant in the 1970s after intradisciplinary fighting between the symbolic camp and the neural network camp. Neural nets regained prominance in the 1980s, advanced by researchers who avoided the symbolic approach. The schism remains until today: Marcus&amp;rsquo;s polemic is itself is a testament to the rift. These are competing paradigms, though there are glimmers of a synthesis on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Short-Term COVID-19 Projections</title>

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the WHO declared COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, to be a global pandemic. The U.S. banned travel from Europe, the NBA suspended its season, and cities across the country implemented bans on large public gathers. Will these efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus be successful? How will we know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, we need to know how many cases of COVID-19 we should expect given current trends. Unfortunately, I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen many readily accessible forecasts that are updated in real time as new data comes in. I realize that things can escalate quickly, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much sense of how soon to expect that to happen. So I set out to produce some short-term projections myself to help calibrate my expectations (and maybe quell some uncertainty-induced anxiety at the same time).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I built this site using Blogdown and Hugo with the Anatole theme. I also relied on Emily Zabor&amp;rsquo;s tutorial for building websites using R Markdown. It is hosted on GitHub pages and you can see the built website files on GitHub.
Some standard-issue info about Hugo is below.
 Written in Go, Hugo is an open source static site generator available under the Apache Licence 2.0. Hugo supports TOML, YAML and JSON data file types, Markdown and HTML content files and uses shortcodes to add rich content. Other notable features are taxonomies, multilingual mode, image processing, custom output formats, HTML/CSS/JS minification and support for Sass SCSS workflows.</description>

      <description>Published Papers Ala&#39; Alrababa&amp;rsquo;h, William Marble, Salma Mousa, and Alexandra Siegel. 2021. Can Exposure to Celebrities Reduce Prejudice? The Effect of Mohamed Salah on Islamophobic Behaviors and Attitudes. American Political Science Review. Publisher version, preprint, replication archive.
Abstract   Can exposure to successful celebrities from a stigmatized group reduce prejudice toward that group writ large? We study the sudden and phenomenal rise to fame of Liverpool F.C. soccer star Mohamed Salah, a visibly Muslim player. We estimate the causal effect of Salah joining Liverpool F.C. on Islamophobia using hate crime reports throughout England, 15 million tweets from British soccer fans, and a survey experiment of Liverpool fans.</description>

      <description>I served as a teaching assistant for both graduate and undergraduate classes at Stanford, including two years as a TA for the quantitative methods sequence for political science Ph.D. students. For this work, I received the Centennial Teaching Assistant Award recognizing outstanding TAs. I have also taught undergraduate courses in game theory and American political institutions. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to share teaching materials upon request.
